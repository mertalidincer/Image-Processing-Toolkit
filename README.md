# Image Processing Toolkit

        This repository contains a collection of Python scripts for performing various image processing tasks using OpenCV and Matplotlib. These scripts are designed to handle common image manipulation operations such as resizing, converting to grayscale, edge detection, and more.

        ## Features
        ## Calsses.py
        1. **View Images in a Folder**: Display images one by one using OpenCV.
        2. **Resize Images**: Resize all images in a folder to a specified dimension.
        3. **Convert to Grayscale**: Convert images to grayscale and save them.
        4. **Display Images with Matplotlib**: Display images using Matplotlib with RGB conversion.
        5. **Edge Detection**: Detect edges in images using the Canny edge detection algorithm.
        6. **Image Slideshow**: Create a slideshow of images with a specified delay.
        7. **Blur Images**: Apply Gaussian blur to images.
        8. **Draw Shapes on Images**: Draw rectangles and circles on images.
        9. **Add Text to Images**: Add custom text to images.
        10. **Rotate Images**: Rotate images 90 degrees clockwise.
        11. **Crop Images**: Crop a specific region from images.

        ## How to Use

        1. Clone the repository:
            ```bash
            git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-processing-toolkit.git
            cd image-processing-toolkit
            ```

        2. Install the required dependencies:

        3. Place your images in the `MRI Competitors Labeled_Images` folder.

        4. Run the scripts in `classes.py` to perform the desired image processing tasks.

        ## Requirements

        - Python 3.x
        - OpenCV
        - Matplotlib

        Feel free to modify the scripts to suit your specific needs!
